## Motivation

This project was created to explore a variety of technologies and patterns I use daily in one place to get a better understanding of those technologies.

Things I would like to explore:

- Functional Programming
- Automated Tests
- Basics of Angular, TypeScript, Rxjs, and Bootstrap
- Synergy that exists between Azure Functions and .Net Core Web Apis
  - Implementations of comparable endpoints in both projects to evaluate the tooling and ecosystems
- Having fun!

## Feedback and Contributing
