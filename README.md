## Motivation

This project was created to explore a variety of technologies and patterns I use daily in one place to get a better understanding of those technologies.

Things I would like to explore:

- Functional Programming
- Automated Tests
- Basics of Angular, TypeScript, Rxjs, and Bootstrap
- Synergy that exists between Azure Functions and .Net Core Web Apis
  - Implementations of comparable endpoints in both projects to evaluate the tooling and ecosystems
- Having fun!

## Roadmap

- MVP

  - Initial Employee CRUD functionality
  - Initial Payroll CRUD functionality
  - Basic charting and analytics of payroll data

- TODOs

  - Move seed data to CosmosDB document instead of boilerplate c# code
  - Refactor client to use Akita state management
  - Toggle between Api and Azure Function backends
  - Advanced analytics like payroll totals by department, risk, and time

## Build / Run

This project uses VS Code [Multi-root Workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).
For the best developer experience, open the workspace directly with VS Code (`code payroll-processor.code-workspace`)
or open the root of the repository in VS Code (`code .`) and when prompted, open the workspace.

### .NET

The Azure Functions solution (`Payroll.Processor.Functions.sln`) is set up as the default solution
for [Omnisharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode), and is loaded as soon as the
VS Code workspace is opened.

If you want to switch to work on the API solution, use the "Omnisharp: Select Project" command from the command palette
and select `Payroll.Processor.Api.sln`.

### Client

- Run the "Client: Serve" VS Code task (this will install packages and start serving the app)

- Optional: Run any of the following tasks

  - Client: Build

### Functions

- Ensure the [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
  VS Code extension is installed.

- Run "Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools" from the command palette.

- [Update Powershell security policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/issues/1821#issuecomment-586925919)

- F5 or run from the VS Code Debug drop down "Function: Run & Attach (Debug)"

- Optional: Run any of the following tasks

  - Function: Run (Debug)
  - Function: Test
  - Function: Build (Debug)
