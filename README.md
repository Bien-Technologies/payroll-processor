# Payroll Processor

![dotnet core - build](https://github.com/KyleMcMaster/payroll-processor/workflows/dotnet%20core%20-%20build/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Motivation
This project was created to explore a variety of technologies and patterns I use daily in one place to get a better understanding of those technologies.

Things I would like to explore:

- Functional Programming
- Automated Tests
- Basics of Angular, TypeScript, Rxjs, and Bootstrap
- Synergy that exists between Azure Functions and .Net Core Web Api
  - Implementations of similar endpoints in both environments to compare tooling and ecosystems
- Having fun!
